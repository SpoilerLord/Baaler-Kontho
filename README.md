  # How to pass a drug test?
To pass a urine test,you need to drink a lot of water before the drug test. After that you will urinate frequently and that will flush out the marijuana metabolites from the bladder. This will lower the concentration of marijuana metabolites in the urine below the detectable level. There's no exact amount of water required to drink because it depends on a person's body mass and metabolism. But in most cases 2-3 liters will be diluteenough to pass a drug test.
**How to drink it safely?** The kidneys can not excrete more than 0.8 to 1.0 liters per hour. So the safe amount os to consume 0.8 liters per hour and start 3-4 hours before the drug test. Drinking this much water will lower creatinine levels and the specific gravity of the urine. It will also change the color of the urine. If therse parameters are out of normal range the sample will be rejected as diluted. That's why you have to use suppliements.

**10 grams of creatine ethynl supplement,
200 grams of Vitamin B &
Electrolyte Solution**

### All should be taken 3 hours before drug test.
